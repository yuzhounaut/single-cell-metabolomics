Visualization provides an ability to comprehend huge amounts of data.

Visualization allows the perception of emergent properties that were not anticipated.

A visualization commonly reveals things not only about the data per se, but about the way the data are collected. Visualization often enables problems with the data to become immediately apparent.

Visualization facilitates hypothesis formation.
